/* Some functions accept a long instead of int for convenience where caller has
a long due to some other interface, and would otherwise have to get a warning,
or cast it (and verify that it wasn't outside the range of an int).

To really support huge (>2GB) files, long isn't a solution, since there's no
guarantee it's more than 32 bits. We'd need to use long long (if available), or
something compiler-specific, and change all places file sizes or offsets are
used. */
